# Pathfinder Visualizer

The Pathfinder Visualizer is a web-based application developed using React and JavaScript. It demonstrates the Dijkstra's algorithm on a 2D maze, showcasing pathfinding capabilities and algorithm visualization.

## Features
- Intuitive User Interface: Users can define start and target nodes, enabling dynamic and real-time visualization of the algorithm's execution.
- Optimized Algorithm: Developed a graph traversal algorithm to efficiently find the shortest path between selected nodes.
- Algorithmic Thinking: Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills through the implementation of the algorithm, highlighting visited nodes and presenting the shortest path.
